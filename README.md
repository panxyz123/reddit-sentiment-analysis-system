# 🚀 Distributed Real-Time Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

## 🎯 Project Core
This project implements a high-throughput sentiment analysis pipeline for Public Opinion Monitoring. When a user queries a keyword, the system executes a Resource-Aware Workflow:

- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Utilizes a Reddit API to fetch real-time posts.

- **Smart Routing**: Fetches real-time Reddit posts; if a Redis Cache Hit exists (1h TTL), it returns results in ～200ms.

- **Optimized Inference**: On a cache miss, a Quantized INT8 ONNX model classifies posts into 6 emotions (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Love, Surprise).

- **Visual Analytics**: Returns a precise percentage breakdown and a Base64-encoded Pie Chart for instant BI visualization.

- **Stability First**: Uses an Idle-Time Sync strategy, only persisting data to PostgreSQL when CPU utilization < 20%, ensuring zero-interference with real-time API requests.

## 🧠 Model End-to-End Fine-tuning Details
- Base Model: distilbert-base-uncased (Chosen for its balance between performance and parameter efficiency).

- Dataset: Hugging Face `emotion`
    - Task: Multi-class classification (6 classes).

    - Data Split: 16,000 training, 2,000 validation, and 2,000 test samples.

    - Label Distribution: Joy & Sadness are predominant. Surprise & Love are minority classes (handled via weighted loss/balancing during training). 

    - To use this dataset: `from datasets import load_dataset`, `emotions = load_dataset("emotion")`

- Objective: Cross-Entropy Loss with AdamW Optimizer.

- Hyperparameters: 
    - Learning Rate: 3e-5
    - Weight_decay=0.01
    - Batch Size: 8
    - Epochs: 3

- Hardware: 1*NVIDIA A10 on Aliyun PAI cloud platform

- Performance: 93.7% accuracy, 93.7% F1, with ~45 min training time
    - ⬆️ +58.5% over baseline, ⬆️ +30% over hybrid Transformer-scikit-learn approaches


## 🛠️ Post-Training Optimization (ONNX ➕ Quantization)
- Export to ONNX: Converted the PyTorch model to a static graph to remove Python interpreter overhead.

- Compression: Reduced model footprint from 268MB (FP32) to 65MB (INT8).

- Operator Fusion: Optimized the computational graph for high-throughput CPU inference.

- Performance: Achieved a 2x latency reduction (from ~400s to <200s) on CPU-bound environments.

- Memory Safety: Implemented reduced batching size and thread-pool constraints to prevent OOM during high-concurrency spikes.


## 🌟 Key Engineering Highlights
### 1️⃣ Distributed Microservices Architecture
Decoupled Model Storage (S3): Model weights are stored in Amazon S3 and loaded dynamically via boto3, reducing Docker image size and enabling seamless model versioning.

Containerized Orchestration: Fully containerized environment using Docker & ECR, deployed on AWS EC2, managing isolated services for API, Caching, and Persistence.

### 2️⃣ High-Performance Caching (2000x Speedup)
By implementing a Cache-Aside Pattern with Redis, the system bypasses expensive Transformer inference for redundant queries, achieving massive latency reduction.

Stress Test Performance Metrics (~250 posts per keyword): 

| Metric | Model Inference (Cold Start) | Redis Cache Hit (Hot) | Improvement | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| CPU Latency | ~40,000 ms | ~200 ms | 2000x | 
| CPU Utilization | 85% - 95% | < 2% | 45x Efficiency | 
| Throughput | ~5 req/s | 10,000+ req/s | Scalability Boost |


### 3️⃣ Intelligent "CPU-Aware" ETL Engine
Designed a robust, Self-Adaptive Sync Script that monitors system health before execution:

- Redis Hot-Words Cache (Threshold < 35%): The system automatically activates the "Hot Words" extraction logic when CPU usage drops below 35%. This preemptively caches high-frequency keywords in Redis to speed up subsequent analytical queries.

- PostgreSQL Synchronization (Threshold < 20%): Data persistence from Redis to PostgreSQL only triggers when the system enters a deep idle state (< 20% CPU). This ensures that heavy Disk I/O and DB handshakes do not cause latency jitter for real-time inference requests.

- Data Integrity (Robustness): Features an automatic "Missing-Data Recovery" logic. It scans Redis keys against the PostgreSQL registry and backfills unsynced records, ensuring 100% data consistency.

### 4️⃣ Dual-Layer Storage Strategy (Efficiency & Durability)
Redis (Speed): Serves as the high-speed "Front-line" for millisecond-level API responses.

PostgreSQL (Durability): Acts as the "Source of Truth" for structured historical data, optimized for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing).


## 📊 Data Visualization (Tableau)
The system connects to PostgreSQL via a Live Connection to provide real-time business insights:

6-Dimensional Sentiment Stacked Bar Chart: Comparative analysis of emotions (Joy, Anger, etc.) across different keywords.

## 📡 API Specification
### **Query Format (Input)**
The API expects a `POST` request with a JSON body defining the search criteria:

- **`keyword`** (String): The search term to fetch from the data source (e.g., Twitter/X API).
    
- **`limit`** (Integer): Number of posts to analyze (max 500 recommended for stability).
    
- **`return_plot`** (Boolean): If `true`, the API returns a Base64 encoded string of the sentiment distribution plot.

### **Result Presentation (Output)**
The API returns a comprehensive JSON object designed for seamless integration with frontend dashboards and BI tools like Tableau:
```

    "keyword": "AI",
    "count": 500,
    "agg": [
        {
            "label": "joy",
            "pct": 64.0        # percentage in fetched posts
            "avg_score": 0.91  # mean confidence
        },
        {
            "label": "fear",
            "pct": 9.0
            "avg_score": 0.86
